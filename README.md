Overview:

In this project, I investigated the way people think about masculinity by applying the KMeans algorithm to 
data from FiveThirtyEight. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-do-men-think-it-means-to-be-a-man/
FiveThirtyEight is a popular website known for their use of statistical analysis in many of their stories.

FiveThirtyEight and WNYC studios used 'masculinity-survey.pdf' to get their male readers' thoughts on masculinity.
FiveThirtyEight's article What Do Men Think It Means To Be A Man? contains their major takeaways.
